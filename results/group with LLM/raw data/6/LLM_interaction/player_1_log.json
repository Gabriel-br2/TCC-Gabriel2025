I should maintain the current configuration, possibly fine-tuning by shifting object 0 slightly toward the cluster of other agents' objects (e.g., around (305, 165)) to experiment with better alignment. Since the agents seem to be converging towards promising areas, incremental movement could help improve the score."

There appears to be minimal intersection or overlap of objects, suggesting no significant interactions or constraining overlaps. The positions of other agents seem to be somewhat dispersed, likely exploring different regions of the field."

For example, positioning object 0 at (300, 300) and object 1 at (350, 350), both with 0° rotation, might be beneficial.",

There appears to be minimal intersection or overlap of objects, suggesting no significant interactions or constraining overlaps. The positions of other agents seem to be somewhat dispersed, likely exploring different regions of the field."

For example, positioning object 0 at (300, 300) and object 1 at (350, 350), both with 0° rotation, might be beneficial.",

The pink objects are situated towards the bottom-left and central-upper regions, indicating ongoing exploration or incremental adjustments. The score remains very low at 6.23%, suggesting little successful overlap or alignment with the objective so far."

Slight adjustments around these positions, such as moving object 0 to (305, 175), could improve overlap with nearby objects of other agents, thus potentially increasing the score.",

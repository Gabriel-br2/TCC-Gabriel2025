Other agents control various objects distributed across the scene, notably the blue, pink, and cyan objects, all positioned far from the yellow objects. The scene indicates a large displacement from previously high-density overlap zones, and the score is still at 0.0%, indicating no meaningful intersection-optimization has been achieved yet."

The background is pink, with other agents' objects scattered across the scene, contributing to a dispersed and non-overlapping configuration.

Small refinements are preferable over large displacements to fine-tune overlaps and accelerate progress towards the objective."

Other agents control various objects distributed across the scene, notably the blue, pink, and cyan objects, all positioned far from the yellow objects. The scene indicates a large displacement from previously high-density overlap zones, and the score is still at 0.0%, indicating no meaningful intersection-optimization has been achieved yet."

Fine-tuning around these positions, particularly small positional shifts or slight rotational tweaks, could help establish overlaps, given previous slight improvements or attempts.",

The next step should be carefully moving the yellow objects slightly closer to potential overlap zones, possibly by a small margin (e.g., 5 pixels), and adjusting their rotations by ±15° to check for overlap emergence. This focused, incremental approach aligns with ongoing exploration and aims to trigger overlap improvements."

The overall scene suggests ongoing fine-tuning for overlaps, with no significant overlaps achieved yet."

This fine-tuning aims to maximize the overlap potential with minimal adjustments, leveraging the recent progress."

The other agents' objects are scattered around, with some near the yellow objects, suggesting ongoing overlap experiments.

Continuing small movements towards each other may reveal overlaps or convergence.",

Slightly moving the objects closer—shifting the first to around (150, 460) and the second to (245, 265)—and experimenting with small rotation tweaks (+/- 15°) could maximize overlap chances. Maintaining this incremental approach aligns with current progress and should improve the global score."

This fine-tuning aims to maximize the overlap potential with minimal adjustments, leveraging the recent progress."

This fine-tuning aims to maximize the overlap potential with minimal adjustments, leveraging the recent progress."

The other agents' objects are scattered, with some nearby, indicating ongoing overlap testing. The recent position of the yellow object at (241, 261) with a 270° rotation shows it is not aligned for optimal overlap, especially with the nearby object at (142, 454)."

Small movements toward each other—about 8-10 pixels—and slight rotational tweaks could enhance overlaps and consequently improve the score.",

Moving the second yellow object toward (150, 460) and slightly rotating it towards 180° or 195°, while maintaining the first at (142, 454) with 180°, will better facilitate overlaps and drive the score upward again."

Maintaining this incremental approach aligns with current progress and should improve the global score."

The other agents' objects are scattered, with some nearby, indicating ongoing overlap testing.

The objects are positioned relatively close to each other but not overlapping in a way that significantly increases the score.
